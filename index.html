        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>SaaS Platform Backend Development</h3>
            <p>Optimized backend API development for a SaaS platform using FastAPI, focusing on high performance and scalability. Implemented a Redis-based rate limiter to efficiently manage API requests and prevent abuse. Integrated full-text search capabilities into PostgreSQL, enabling advanced search functionalities across the platform. Additionally, employed SQLAlchemy for sophisticated database management, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance. This project significantly enhanced the platform's ability to handle large-scale operations and provided a seamless experience for end-users.</p>

            <h3>Image Processing Pipeline with FastAPI, Celery, and Supabase</h3>
            <p>In this project, I have developed a robust image processing pipeline utilizing FastAPI, Celery, and Supabase to handle and optimize image data efficiently. The pipeline automates the entire workflow from image retrieval to processing and storage. Initially, images are downloaded from URLs listed in a CSV file. These images are then compressed by 50% to reduce file size without significantly compromising quality. The processed images are uploaded to Supabase, with the original images stored in an 'input' folder and the compressed images in an 'output' folder. The original CSV file is updated with new columns containing the URLs of the compressed images, facilitating easy access and management. The project demonstrates the integration of modern technologies for scalable image processing and storage solutions.</p>
